# Spring Security Project with JWT (EmbarkX)

## Overview

This Spring Boot project demonstrates how to set up JWT authentication with Spring Security. The application provides
endpoints for user authentication, role-based access control, and integrates with an H2 database for user management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to sign in with a username and password.
- **JWT Token Generation**: Generates a JWT token upon successful authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricts access to endpoints based on user roles.
- **H2 Database Integration**: Uses H2 in-memory database to store user credentials.
- **Custom Exception Handling**: Provides custom error messages for unauthorized access and authentication failures.
